Data Table

	Entity Name:  PBG011
	Entity Description:  This data set includes canopy cover of all plant species is recorded in 20 circular 10 m2 plots in watersheds of the patch-burn grazing experiment. Plots are arranged in 4 transects (A-D) of 5 plots each. Pre-treatment data was collected in 2008 from all units except C1SB, and from all units in 2009. Cattle grazing started in 2010 in C03A/C03B/C03C and C01A and in 2011 in C3SA/C3SB/C3SC and C1SB.
