load packages.tidyverse is a collection of R packages (like dplyr, ggplot2, readr, etc.) designed for data science.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

load data
```{r}
vegetation<- read.csv("PVC021.csv")

```

```{r}
summary (vegetation)
```
Take the watershed names in the column, and tell R to treat them as groups or labels, not as text.
```{r}
vegetation$WaterShed <- factor(vegetation$WaterShed)
```
This returns a vector of all the unique (non-duplicate) values in the WaterShed column of vegetation data frame.
```{r}
unique(vegetation$WaterShed)
```
